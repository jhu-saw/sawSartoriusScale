# sawSartoriusScale

This SAW component contains code for interfacing with Sartorius scales (www.sartorius.com/).  It compiles on Windows, Linux and likely MacOS.

The `ros` folder contains code for a ROS node that interfaces with the sawSartoriusScale component and publishes the measured force (based on weight).  To build the ROS node, make sure you use `catkin build`.

If needed, one can also add OpenIGTLink support using sawOpenIGTLink (contact the sawSartoriusScale developers if you need help with this).

# Build

You can find some documentation re. compiling cisst and SAW components in the [dVRK wiki](https://github.com/jhu-dvrk/sawIntuitiveResearchKit/wiki/CatkinBuild#catkin-build-and-rosinstall)(best source if you're using Linux with ROS) and the [cisst wiki](https://github.com/jhu-cisst/cisst/wiki/Compiling-cisst-and-SAW-with-CMake)(more details and provides instructions for Windows as well).

For Linux with ROS, we provide a rosinstall file to retrieve all the git repositories you need for sawSartoriusScale:
```

# Running the examples
 
## Linux permissions
 
Sartorius scales use a serial port to communicate.  When connecting your scale to your computer, a pseudo device will be added to the `/dev` directory. Â  Usually something like `/dev/ttyS01`, `/dev/ttyUSB0` or `/dev/ttyACM0`.  Using the command `dmesg` can help identify which device is used.  Check the file permissions on said device, e.g.,
```sh
ls -al /dev/ttyUSB0 
crw-rw---- 1 root dialout 188, 0 Jan  3 09:32 /dev/ttyUSB0
```
On Ubuntu, the OS usually sets the ownership of `/dev/ttyUSB0` to `root` and the group to `dialout`.   To grant permissions to read and write to the device, use the command `sudo adduser <user_id> dialout` to add users to the `dialout` group.   Please note that the user has to logout/login for the new group membership to take effect.
